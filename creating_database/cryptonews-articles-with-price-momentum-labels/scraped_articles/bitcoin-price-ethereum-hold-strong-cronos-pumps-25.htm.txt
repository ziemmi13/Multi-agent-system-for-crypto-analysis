On November 15, Bitcoin bounced off a support level of $15,800 along with resistance near $17,150, gaining more than 5%. On the other hand, Ethereum, the second-most valuable cryptocurrency, has recovered over 6% in the last 24 hours to trade at $1,257. Major cryptocurrencies were trading in the green early on November 15, as the global crypto market cap increased over 4% in the previous day to $842.95 billion. Over the last 24 hours, the total crypto market volume has increased by 37% to $82.88 billion. DeFi’s total volume is currently $4.13 billion, accounting for 5% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The total volume of all stablecoins is now $77.78 billion, accounting for 93% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. Let’s take a look at the top altcoin gainers and losers over the last 24 hours. 
Cronos (CRO), Quant (QNT), and Lido DAO (LDO) are three of the top 100 coins that have gained value in the last 24 hours. The CRO price has soared by more than 21% to $0.072, the QNT grew by more than 20% to $119, and the LDO increased by nearly 13%. We don’t have many losers today because the overall market sentiment is positive. Axie Infinity (AXS) has dropped less than 1% in the last 24 hours to trade at $7.25.UNUS SED LEO (LEO) has dropped by more than 0.50% in the last 24 hours. 
The current Bitcoin price is $16,766, and the 24-hour trading volume is $47 billion. Bitcoin has increased by 4% in the last 24 hours. CoinMarketCap currently ranks first, with a live market cap of $352 billion, up from $322 billion. It has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 BTC coins and a circulating supply of 19,207,618.00 BTC coins. The technical side of Bitcoin hasn’t changed much, as it’s still trading exactly in line with our previous Bitcoin price prediction. Bitcoin is consolidating in a broad trading range of $18,000 to $16,000, with a breakout determining future price action. In the 4-hour timeframe, Bitcoin has completed a 38.2% Fibonacci retracement at the $18,100 level, and it is now stable. A positive crossover occurs when the price rises above $18,100. This level may expose the Bitcoin price to the 61.8% Fibonacci level of $19,350. Bitcoin could fall below $15,965 if it fails to break through the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $18.250. One forward-looking technical indicator, the MACD, has crossed into the buy zone, while the 50-day moving average and the relative strength index (RSI) continue to indicate a bearish market. If Bitcoin’s closing prices stay below $18,000, it’s possible that the currency’s decline may continue; $16,000 and 15,850 are nearby levels of support. 
The current price of Ethereum is $1,258, with a 24-hour trading volume of $14 billion. In the last 24 hours, Ethereum has gained over 6%. With a live market cap of $153 billion, CoinMarketCap currently ranks second. It has a circulating supply of 122,373,866 ETH coins and no maximum supply. There has been a bullish retracement on the daily chart, and Ethereum has reclaimed the $1,262 level. The 50-day moving average provides support for the $1,370 level as an immediate resistance level for Ethereum. The rebound could speed up to $1,506 or $1,670 if the bullish crossover above $1,370 holds. Support is still around $1,170 or $1,095. If ETH falls below this level, it could reach $1,000, or $881, but this appears unlikely for the time being. 
Cronos’s current price is $0.073, with a 24-hour trading volume of $240 million. CRO has increased by over 25% in the last 24 hours. CoinMarketCap currently ranks #29, with a live market cap of $1.8 billion. There are 25,263,013,692 CRO coins in circulation, with a maximum supply of 30,263,013,692 CRO coins. CRO is on a bullish streak, having risen above the $0.064 resistance level to complete a 38.2% Fibonacci retracement at $0.071. On the plus side, a bullish breakout of the $0.071 level can expose CRO to the $0.0765 or $0.0820 levels, which represent the 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement levels, respectively. The 50-day moving average, on the other hand, is likely to extend resistance near the $0.089 level. The MACD and RSI are diverging, as the MACD is in a buying zone and the RSI is in a selling zone. CRO may find immediate support at $0.064, and a breach of this level may expose its price to $0.053.
