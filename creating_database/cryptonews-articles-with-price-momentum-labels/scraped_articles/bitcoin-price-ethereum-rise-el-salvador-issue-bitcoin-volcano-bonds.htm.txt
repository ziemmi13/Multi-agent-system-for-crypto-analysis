Maria Luisa Hayem Brevé, El Salvador’s Minister of the Economy, has introduced a measure to legalize the issuing of digital assets, clearing the way for the sale of the country’s first “volcano” bonds, which are backed by bitcoin. This groundbreaking program, which was first launched exactly one year ago today, is aimed at luring investors and financial resources to El Salvador.  What's up with El Salvador's volcano bonds? 🌋🌋🌋At @adoptingBTC, @maxkeiser reported that the securities laws that go with the volcano bonds are "basically imminent" and "the actual bond is ready to go"Would this be a good time for the volcano bonds? pic.twitter.com/wy1YWSLAK8 Plans to issue $1 billion in bonds on the Liquid Network, a federated Bitcoin sidechain, were announced at the time, with half of the proceeds going toward buying bitcoin outright and the other half going toward expanding the region’s energy and bitcoin mining infrastructure.  El Salvador is planning to issue next year $1 billion in bonds backed by bitcoin, the latest effort by the economically stressed Central American nation to attract crypto capital https://t.co/Ia9aJXNxLR A sidechain is a separate blockchain that operates in tandem with another, allowing tokens from the first blockchain to be used safely on the second blockchain despite the fact that the sidechain operates under a different set of rules, has different performance requirements, and uses different security mechanisms.  🌐 #cryptonews in brief 🌐'El Salvador Takes First Step To Issue Bitcoin Volcano Bonds'from bitcoinmagazine Summary :maria luisa hayem brevé, el salvador's minister of economy, has submitted a digital assets issuance bill to t… Liquid is a Bitcoin-compatible sidechain that enables bidirectional Bitcoin transactions across the Liquid and Bitcoin networks. L-BTC is short for “Liquid Bitcoin,” which is the Liquid network’s representation of bitcoin. The network’s participants, known as “functionaries,” control and safeguard a quantity of BTC that is verifiably comparable to the amount in question. The current Bitcoin price is $16,175, and the 24-hour trading volume is $33 billion. Bitcoin has increased by more than 2% in the last 24 hours. CoinMarketCap currently ranks first, with a live market cap of $310 billion. It has a total supply of 21,000,000 BTC coins and a circulating supply of 19,214,437 BTC coins. On the technical front, Bitcoin has broken through a downward trendline at $16,350, and a bullish breakout of this is exposing BTC price to the $17,000 target.  On the 4-hour timeframe, Bitcoin formed a bullish engulfing candle and also violated a descending triangle pattern, indicating the possibility of an uptrend continuation.  Because the RSI and MACD are both in a buying zone, we can expect the uptrend to continue. Further up, a break of the $17,000 level could propel BTC to the $17,600 level. On the downside, Bitcoin’s support remains at $16,000, and a breach of this level could send BTC down to $15,670. The current price of Ethereum is $1,161, with a 24-hour trading volume of $12 billion. In the last 24 hours, Ethereum has gained over 5%. CoinMarketCap currently ranks #2, with a live market cap of $142 billion. It has a circulating supply of 122,373,866 ETH coins and no maximum supply. Ethereum is attempting to reclaim the $1,200 level on the 4-hour chart. The ETH/USD has recovered from the $1,080 support level and is now heading north toward the $1,185 level. On the 4-hour timeframe, the ETH/USD pair has formed bullish engulfing candles, indicating the possibility of an uptrend. However, Ethereum must break above $1,190 before we can expect more buying until $1,235 or $1,290. On the downside, Ethereum is likely to find support near $1,120, and a break below this level could send ETH as low as $1,080 or $1,030.
