The Bitcoin price consolidated near the $21,158 level on November 6, but a closing of candles above the $21,000 level has increased the odds of a bullish trend continuation. Whereas Ethereum is also struggling below the $1,665 resistance level, it is now attempting to complete a retracement at the 1,600 level before a potential uptrend. Major cryptocurrencies were trading in a mixed bag early on November 6, with the global crypto market worth falling 0.61% to $1.06 trillion on the previous day. Over the last 24 hours, the total crypto market volume fell 39% to $70 billion. The overall volume in DeFi was $4.78 billion, accounting for over 6% of the entire 24-hour volume in the crypto market. The overall volume of stablecoins was $63.71 billion, accounting for 90% of the total 24-hour crypto market volume.

After breaking through the major resistance level of $21,000 to reach $21,480, the BTC/USD pair entered the overbought zone. Since BTC has begun a bearish correction, its price may fall to $21,000 before rebounding. Meanwhile, the RSI and MACD are exiting the overbought zone and will soon be in the buying zone, allowing investors to go long again. A breakout of the $21,475 level could expose BTC to resistance levels of $22,000 and $22,750. A break below $21,000 may expose BTC to the $20,650 level, which is extended by the 50-day moving average. Over $21,000, the bullish bias remains strong, so keep an eye on it. Ethereum behaves similarly to Bitcoin, with less volatility and a bearish correction. The current price of Ethereum is $1,617, with a 24-hour trading volume of $10 billion. Ethereum has lost more than 2% in the last 24 hours, and it is now ranked second on CoinMarketCap, with a live market capitalization of $197 billion, down from $202 billion yesterday. On the technical front, Ethereum is exhibiting a bearish correction, with the price heading lower to complete a 38.2% Fibonacci retracement at $1,600. A break below this level may expose ETH to levels of $1,585 or $1,568, which are extended by 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement points, respectively.  On the plus side, Ethereum’s major resistance level remains at a double top of $1,664. A bullish breakout of this level may allow for additional buying up to $1,700 or $1,720. The current price of Chiliz is $0.2707, with a 24-hour trading volume of $681 million. Chiliz has increased by 6.17% in the previous 24 hours.
