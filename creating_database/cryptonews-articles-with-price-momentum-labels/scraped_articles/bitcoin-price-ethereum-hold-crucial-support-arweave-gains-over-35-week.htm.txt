The Bitcoin price plunged sharply and broke below a major support level of $21,000. Likewise, Ethereum also lost over 2% to complete a 61.8% Fibonacci correction at $1,566. After Beijing said it had no plans to change its zero COVID-19 policy, US stock futures, cryptocurrencies and commodities fell in Asia on Monday. However, resilient Asian markets helped mitigate the selling. However, over the weekend, health officials reaffirmed their commitment to the “dynamic-clearing” approach to COVID cases as soon as they occur, which caused risk assets to fall. Major cryptocurrencies were trading in a mixed bag early on November 7, as the global crypto market cap fell over 1% to $1.04 trillion on the previous day. Over the last 24 hours, overall crypto market volume fell less than 0.50% to $69.99 billion. The overall volume in DeFi was $3.91 billion, accounting for over 5% of the total 24-hour volume in the crypto market. The entire volume of stablecoins was $63.75 billion, accounting for 91% of the overall 24-hour volume of the crypto market. In the last 24 hours, the top performers were Litecoin (LTC), Polygon (MATIC), and Chiliz (CHZ). Overall, the bullish bias is a bit weaker as sellers have dominated the market.  Litecoin and Polygon have risen by more than 3% to $71.4 and $1.20, respectively. At the same time, CHZ has increased by about 0.5% to $0.27. In the last 24 hours, Solana (SOL) has reversed and given up most of its gains, losing more than 10% to trade at $32.25. ImmutableX (IMX) has dropped more than 9% to around $0.6025, while Loopring (LRC) is down about 9% to $0.3370. The current Bitcoin price is $20,892 and the 24-hour trading volume is $38 billion. Bitcoin lost over 1.5% during the Asian session. CoinMarketCap currently ranks it first, with a live market cap of $438 billion, up from $406 billion yesterday. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, has breached a strong support level of $20,900. On the downside, BTC may find immediate support near $20,600, a level supported by a 50-day moving average. A bearish crossover below the 50-day moving average is likely to extend the downtrend until the $20,400 or $20,000 level. The upward channel on the 4-hour timeframe is supporting the chances of a bullish trend continuation while providing support near $20,400. On the upside, Bitcoin’s immediate resistance is at $21,000, and a break above this level has the potential to take BTC to $21,500 or $22,200.  Let’s use today’s price of $21,000 as a pivot point. On Monday, the second leading cryptocurrency, Ethereum, lost around 2% in the last 24 hours to trade at $1,588. Now ranked second on CoinMarketCap, with a live market capitalization of $193 billion, down from $197 billion yesterday. On the 4-hour chart, Ethereum has fallen below the 50-day moving average, which had been extending support at $1,590. The same level is now acting as a barrier.  On the downside, Ethereum is finding immediate support near the $1,566 level, which is a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level. A break of this level could send ETH to the 78.6% Fibo level at $1,540. A surge in ETH demand can slice through a 50-day SMA at $1,590 to retest a resistance area of $1,620. A cross above this level has the potential to send ETH toward the $1,660 level.   The current price of Arweave is $14.13, with a 24-hour trading volume of $126 million. Arweave has fallen by over 6% in the previous 24 hours, however, it has gained over 35% in the last seven days. With a live market cap of $471 million, CoinMarketCap now ranks #84.  It has a total quantity of 66,000,000 AR coins and a circulating circulation of 33,394,701 AR coins. On the technical front, the AR/USDT pair has fallen to $14 as early buyers appear to be profiting. AR has already completed a 50% Fibonacci retracement at $14, and a break below this level could lead to a 61.8% Fib level of $13. Overall, the trading bias is bullish, with the 50-day moving average providing support at $13. AR’s immediate resistance remains at $15 and $16.50 on the upside. A break above this level could take AR to the $17.95 level. The D2T presale’s second stage has already sold out, earning $5.16 million in just over two weeks.
