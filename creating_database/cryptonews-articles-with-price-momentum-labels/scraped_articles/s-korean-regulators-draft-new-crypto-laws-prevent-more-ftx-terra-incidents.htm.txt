Financial regulators in South Korea want to impose a raft of new crypto-related laws in direct response to the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange and the implosion of Terra ecosystem coins in May. Thus far, most South Korean crypto exchanges have been left relatively unscathed by the FTX fallout – with the exception of Gopax, which had offered customers access to DeFi services in conjunction with a Digital Currency Group-affiliated company.
